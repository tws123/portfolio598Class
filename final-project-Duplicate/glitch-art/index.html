    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sketch, made collaboratively with Kelly Graham, creates a photographic effect that replicates the style of contemporary American artist, Chuck Close.
      Close divides both his original source images and his canvases into grids. He then fills each grid unit with groups of discrete shapes (rectangles, 
      loops, and dots) painted from a simplified range of colors within each unit. This sketch digitally replicates his process using the get() function to sample
      and store RGB values and nested for loops to draw discrete shapes within the parameters of the grid.
