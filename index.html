    <h1>Tess 598 Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I'm a first year HCDE MS student (I finished the certificate last spring) preparing for a career change. My background is in the biological sciences (cardiac flow modeling, clinical immunogenetics, and hematopathology at Fred Hutch, Hematologics, Barlow Scientific). I've always had an interest in design and technology and decided a few years ago to transition out of benchwork science into something new, perhaps designing improved interfaces for laboratory technologies.</p>
    <p>I have very little coding experience (only what I picked up in Physical Computing 539, a UW community workshop on Python, and a smattering of HTML from Lynda.com). I would like to understand coding fundamentals so that I'm more aware of developers' options and constraints. At a minimum, I'd like to have the technical vocabulary to converse with developer teams and some coding literacy (I'd like to be able to read some basic programs and understand what they do). Ideally, I'd like to develop sufficient programming proficiency to write clean code myself.</p>
